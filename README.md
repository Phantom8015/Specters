# What does Specters do?

Specters is an AI powered learning platform tailored to teach people anything they want to learn about by generating courses.

# What does a Specters course look like?

- 3-8 parts/chapters relating to the topic
- In each part/chapter, 3-5 points of detail (code snippets when available)
- To progress from one part to another, you have to answer 3-5 questions and get at least 50%
- If you get 50% or under, then you have to redo that part with different questions
- Users can generate however many courses they want

# How do I use Specters?

Using Specters is so simple, you only need 2 steps:

**Step 1.**
Log in with Google.

**Step 2.**
Once logged in, a user can input a subject or question they have into the "What do you wanna learn?" input.
After they press enter, a course gets generated.

## It's that easy!

###### Note: Specters is not the original name. It's the only one I had a domain for. This was meant to be called Dyscover
